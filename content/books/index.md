# Books

Reading books is one of my favourite pass times. I like to read all kinds of books including Non-Fiction, History, Science, Biographies, Finance, Classics.

First book I ever read was Dracula by Bram Stoker and that got me hooked on reading.

These are some of the books I have in my library. I have given a star rating to the books I have read, the others either I have not read or would like to read again.

<div class="books-list">
  {%- for book in books -%}
    <div class="book" style="background-image: url('/images/covers/{{ book.image }}')">
